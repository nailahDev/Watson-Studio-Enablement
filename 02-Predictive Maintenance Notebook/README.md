# Predicting Machine Failure: Exploring Device Data from Watson IoT Platform using Jupyter Notebooks 

1. Start from Watson Studio's main dashboard.

<br></br>

2. Import a dataset (can be found in the current folder on this GitHub repository, named 'cc_applications.csv').

<br></br>

3. Now we can find the dataset in the **Data Assets** panel.

<br></br>

4. Create a new **Notebook**.

<br></br>

5. Select the **From URL** tab to import a notebook.

<br></br>

6. Type in a name for your notebook. In the **Notebook URL** field, type the following url:  
- [https://github.com/nailahDev/Watson-Studio-Enablement/blob/master/02-Predictive%20Maintenance%20Notebook/Predicting%20Machine%20Failure%20Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/nailahDev/Watson-Studio-Enablement/blob/master/02-Predictive%20Maintenance%20Notebook/Predicting%20Machine%20Failure%20Notebook.ipynb)

Then click **Create**.

<br></br>

7. Now you can see the notebook. It will have all the details for developing the model and deployment steps.

<br></br>

8. To Load Data from IBM Cloud Object Storage use the insert to code feature on the right, select insert R data frame

<br></br>

9. The code will be inserted to the cell, go ahead and run the cell

<br></br>

10. the Data will be loaded from Cloud object storage to a table.  
![10](https://github.com/nailahDev/Watson-Studio-Enablement/blob/master/02-Predictive%20Maintenance%20Notebook/Images/10.png)
<br></br>

11. Run the next cell to load the required libraries

<br></br>

12. if you continou to run all the cells you will get information and visulasation about the sensors
